# Python-Repository
This repository consists of various python codes written for various challenges, tasks and projects.

This branch contains the finite difference method. It is used to calculate European and American options. 

The file ComputationalFinanceClass.py is a master class that contains various different functions that range from calculating the payout of an option, to calculating the Greeks of an option and even to jump diffusion Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, it contains five finite difference methods: implicit, explicit, Crank-Nicolson, theta-scheme and radial basis function finite difference method. One can easily call any of the functions by just satisfying the requirements. 

I have codes for all the functions in the master class. However, these codes are created to satisfy the requirements of the various homework assignments. A lot of them are a bit convoluted and unimpressive. Therefore, these files are omitted. 

One of the python files included finite_difference_american_put.py is written for another class. It implements the implicit scheme for the American put with a specific boundary condition. A free boundary graph can be generated by capturing the region at which the continuation region is no longer profitable. 

A binomial tree model for American put option coded in python is also added to highlight the discrete case.
